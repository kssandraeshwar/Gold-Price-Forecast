#  Gold Price Forecasting Using Time Series & Machine Learning

This project aims to accurately predict the future price of gold (GLD) using a variety of forecasting models, including deep learning (LSTM), machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forest), and statistical approaches (ARIMA, Prophet). The best results were achieved using a **Multivariate LSTM model** that incorporates various economic indicators.

##  Objective

* Forecast gold prices using time series and machine learning techniques
* Compare model performances across univariate and multivariate settings
* Analyze the influence of external features such as stock indices, oil prices, silver, and forex rates on gold

##  Model Evaluation

| Model               | RMSE     | MAE      |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| LSTM (Univariate)   | Moderate | Moderate |
| LSTM (Multivariate) | ‚úÖ Low    | ‚úÖ Low    |
| ARIMA               | Moderate | Moderate |
| Prophet             | Moderate | Moderate |
| XGBoost             | Good     | Good     |
| Random Forest       | Good     | Good     |

 **Multivariate LSTM gave the best performance** with the lowest RMSE and MAE.
